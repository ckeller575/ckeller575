Hello!\
My name is Chase Keller, and I am an undegraduate CS student at Texas Tech University!\
On this github, I plan to display projects that I am proud of.\
Currently I have posted:\
-A binary expression tree that converts a mathematical expression into a tree, then prints the result (C++).\
-A simple UI driven menu that shows different sorting algorithms (C++)\
-A program that calculates the billing for theoretical ISP company.\
--The code takes an input text file (usage), and generates and output file (charges) (C)\
